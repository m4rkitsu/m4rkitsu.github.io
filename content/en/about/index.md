## Biography
Hi! My name is Marcos, and I’m a 21-year-old Cybersecurity student. I own the **OSCP+** Certification. On the Internet, you might know me as **Marki** or **Markitsu**. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity for Information Technology Environments.

I spend most of my time coding, solving CTFs, or overall, studying. My passion lies into hacking and finding creative ways to solve problems.

This blog is my way of documenting my journey while sharing, not just my progress but also tools, techniques, and lessons I pick up along the way. I hope it becomes a resource for others, whether you’re a beginner exploring cybersecurity or an experienced hacker looking for fresh perspectives.

Feel free to reach out to any of my Media if you have any questions or ideas!
